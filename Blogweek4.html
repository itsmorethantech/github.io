<h1>How to build a PC. Part 3&nbsp;</h1>
<p>You have now gotten your PC! But you can&rsquo;t use it yet!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to add the OS.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have access to your desired OS (I recommend Windows 10 have but you can also use Linux)&nbsp;</p>
<p>And make sure you have downloaded it onto a USB drive or written it onto a disk (If you have a built-in or USB disk-reader).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be careful when downloading your OS onto a USB from a Mac because it formats USB drives differently from other systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you need to open your UEFI (Or BIOS). When you power on your PC, tap either the F1, F2, Fn + F2, Del, F12... it gets a tad complicated with all the differences between makers/manufacturers, so you should hold them all down or play around until something happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you get into it, you can then choose your boot device (USB or disk drive with the operating system), there are some other settings that you can change, but I recommend doing that part later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the OS is variable with so many different ones you might have, but it usually goes something like this:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Possibly agree to Terms &amp; Conditions.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Connect to a network.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Set language if you have not chosen it during the download phase.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Set your date &amp; time.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Maybe log in to your account.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Set up additional services like Cortana.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Then download the drivers for your PC parts.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you are free to explore your new PC.</p>
